# dx-demo-widgets-core

This module implement a widget feature for Jahia DX.

It implements a new customizable widget area that can be added to regular DX pages that adds further capabilities for post-log-in users to customize their DX pages.
These areas present a pre-configured set of widget components to any guest or logged-in user, but allow logged in users to customize this page areas by:
 a) Removing widgets(components) that were set up by the administrator by default 
 b) customize settings of a widget(component) predefined by an administrator, such as change predefined stock symbol of the stock widget 
 c) add new widgets to the area, from a list of widget types that are made available by an administrator, and customize its settings 
 d) reorder these widgets as desired on the page
 e) reset the area to preconfigured settings if desired
 
 The github repository https://github.com/Jahia/dx-demo-widgets provides examples of widgets that can be used in the widget area
